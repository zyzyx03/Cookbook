# The Cookbook

A cookbook in the programming context is collection of tiny programs that each demonstrate a particular programming concept. The Cookbook Method is the process of learning a programming language by building up a repository of small programs that implement specific programming concepts. Starting with a Hello World program and building the knowledge piece by piece on top of that.
